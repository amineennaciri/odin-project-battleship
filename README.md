# odin-project-battleship
This is the battleship project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about practicing the testing using JEST and mock functions.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in testing a script of code.

Self-reflection and conclusion: this was an opportunity to practice testing using JEST and mock functions.
